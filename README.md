# Weather App

This is a 5 day weather forecast app tyhat hero's todays date using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). and uses [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to make use of CSS in JS. And was designed to be responsize accross most breakpoints.

Unfortunatley was not able to write any test scripts. The openweather API exposes a private key publicly and ideally for security reasons it would be best to move this server side with some kind of token authentication.

Due to future changes with openweather discontinuing the search by city name in their API there will be a requirement to change the apps search behaviour in the future to use geocoding see this [documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

The current background image only changes on refresh, ideally I would have liked to have the background image change when either the temperature changes or a new city is searched.

To use, simply click in the search field and type your city or country or city and country name. Using the country abbreviation code eg. AU works best in this last scenario.

## Install
to install run `npm install` *yarn or yarn install currently not working*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
